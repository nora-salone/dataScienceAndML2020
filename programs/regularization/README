This is a simple example to show how the regularization works
and to get familiar with the sklearn library.
The main code is in the regularization.py file.
You should run it by typing:
python regularization.py

For the purpose of this exercices we consider the simple noisy sine function.
See the details of the data model in model.py file. 

We will try to fit the polynomial model to it. We use linear regression
and rigid regression which is the linear regression with the quadratic penalty term added.
The penalty term strength is determined by the alpha parameter value (according to the lectures
notation it was called lambda). On the other hand the the complexity of the model can be changed
by changing the degree of the polynomial. 

1.Read the code and try to understand how it works
2.By changing the values of degree and alpha observe the interplay of overfitting/bias
3.For which values one can obtained the reasonable fit to data ?
4.Plot the training and test errors as a function of polynomial degree (for fixed alpha)
5.Plot the training and test errors as a function of regularization term (for fixed degree).
